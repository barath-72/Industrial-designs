Obsidian is a concept product created by Mr. Harish, a masters student at Melbourne University and I designed this product for him.

Obsidian is a product for elderly to monitor and record their feelings and messages. The product is slightly bigger than the size of thumb

The device has single button functionality from the top and a power/volume on its sides

Its like a personal assistant, The user will hold this device in their hand and when they engage it thay can records their words and feelings. 

This will be feeded to cloud which can be accessed by their family and their doctors. This project was seemingly a 'hit' in Mr. Harish's university
