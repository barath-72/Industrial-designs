A Research paper on this project is soon to be published.

This paper focuses on design improvements that can be made to multirotor Unmanned Aerial vehicles(UAVs) that are vastly developing technology with applications in logistics 
and payload delivery. The two main barriers in UAVs are, flight time, and payload capacity. Both these are very important factors for logistics where the UAV has to travel long 
distances with payloads. Discussions on a newly proposed simple design or a manufacturing addition to existing quadcopters are carried out. Implementing a mechanism that induces
a wing to the UAV and improving the performance of the UAV in terms of flight time will be the key goal of this study. This research was done on a specific model of 
Vertical TakeOff and Landing(VTOL) UAV and the design and development of a foldable wing for it. The wing unfolds itself when the drone cruises for long distances at a 
constant velocity. The target requirement is to carry a delivery payload of 1 kg for 9 km of its start with a regular customisable flight drone. By this design, it is expected 
that the droneâ€™s efficiency in terms of range would be increased by 27% to 30%. A lift-producing wing has to be designed in such a way that it could attain a higher 
Wing Cubic Load and maintain stability for a different body wing ratio. Computational Fluid dynamics analysis is performed to simulate the lift generated by the wing. 
Wings fold during the requirement of high maneuverability. This mechanism is achieved using the String-lever mechanism. This hybrid drone provides the users the advantage of a 
drone and a flight for longer-distance and while carrying payloads. The process carried out for design, validations and future scope are also discussed in this work.
